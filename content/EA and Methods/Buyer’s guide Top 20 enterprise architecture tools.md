## These popular and emerging EA tools offer businesses everything they need to support enterprise architecture and digital transformation.

## Enterprise architecture (EA) explained

In the beginning, no one needed [enterprise architecture (EA)](https://www.cio.com/article/222421/what-is-enterprise-architecture-a-framework-for-transformation.html) tools. A back of an envelope would do in the early years. Thomas Watson Jr., one of the leaders of IBM, [supposedly said](https://freakonomics.com/2008/04/17/our-daily-bleg-did-ibm-really-see-a-world-market-for-about-five-computers/) in 1940s, “I think there is a world market for about five computers.”

The modern enterprise, however, is much different. Some employees have more than five computers on their desk alone. Even a small organization may have thousands of machines; some can easily have more than a million. That’s before the sensors and smart gadgets that make up the internet of things are taken into account.

EA systems track all these machines and the software that runs on them — not to mention how these software layers interact. Because of this, EA tools are the single source of truth for managing these burgeoning virtual worlds.

Enterprise architecture is the practice of analyzing, designing, planning, and implementing enterprise analysis to successfully execute on business strategies. EA helps organizations structure IT projects and policies to achieve desired business results, to stay agile and resilient in the face of rapid change, and to stay on top of industry trends and disruptions using architecture principles and practices, a process also known as enterprise architectural planning (EAP).

Modern EA strategies now extend this philosophy to the entire business, not just IT, to ensure the business is aligned with digital transformation strategies and technological growth. EA is especially useful for large businesses going through digital transformation, because it focuses on bringing legacy processes and applications together to form a more seamless environment.

### What to know about the discipline of enterprise architecture

EA is guided by the organization’s business requirements — it helps lay out how information, business, and technology flow together. This has become a priority for businesses that are trying to keep up with new technologies such as the cloud, internet of things (IoT), machine learning, and other emerging trends that prompt digital transformation.

The process is driven by a “comprehensive picture of an entire enterprise from the perspectives of owner, designer, and builder,” according to the [Enterprise Architecture Body of Knowledge (EABOK)](https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Architecture-Knowledge-Complete-Guide/dp/1867429543). Unlike other frameworks, EA doesn’t include a formal documentation structure; instead, it’s intended to offer a more holistic view of the enterprise.

Another main priority with EA is agility and ensuring that your [EA strategy has a strong focus on agility and agile adoption](https://www.cio.com/article/302381/enterprise-architecture-in-the-agile-era-less-policing-more-coaching.html). With a solid EA strategy, companies can better weather complex and fast-moving change, and can even put your organization in a position to thrive during turbulent times. Organizations that scored in the top quartile for EA maturity in a [recent Bizzdesign survey](https://content.bizzdesign.com/state-of-enterprise-architecture-2022-report/p/1?&utm_source=partner&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=state-of-ea-2022) were three times more likely to report having organizational agility, which has been crucial during the past few years with the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 20% of respondents said that their EA programs allowed for faster innovation and faster time to market, while just 6% claimed that [enterprise architects](https://www.cio.com/article/193329/what-is-an-enterprise-architect-a-vital-role-for-it-operations.html) were included in agile teams and had the authority to influence technology decisions.

A good EA strategy considers the latest innovations in business processes, organizational structure, agility, information systems, and technologies. It will also include standard language and best practices for business processes, including analyzing where processes can be integrated or eliminated throughout the organization. The goal of any good EA strategy is to improve the efficiency, timeliness, and reliability of business information. Of course, to implement any EA strategy, you will also need to ensure that you [have buy-in from other executives and stakeholders](https://www.cio.com/article/307187/5-steps-to-minimum-viable-enterprise-architecture.html).

There are [several benefits to enterprise architecture](https://www.cio.com/article/350284/five-areas-where-ea-matters-more-than-ever.html), including resiliency and adaptability, managing supply chain disruptions, staff recruitment and retention, improved product and service delivery, and tracking data and APIs. EA can offer support for redesigns and reorganization, especially during major organizational changes, mergers, or acquisitions. It’s also useful for bringing more discipline into the organization by standardizing and consolidating processes for more consistency.

In 2022, Bizzdesigns asked respondents what IT benefits their EA program currently delivers and the top response was improved IT investment decisions. Other benefits include improved service-orientation via APIs and the cloud, rationalized and less costly application portfolios, reduced risk and cost of unsupported technology, improved information management and security, solutions to reuse existing IT assets, better performance and resilience, faster and more successful implementations and updates, and better automation.

In terms of business benefits, respondents cited improvements with the alignment of capabilities with strategy, business investment decisions, compliance and risk management, business processes, collaboration between functions, business insights, [business agility and continuity](https://www.cio.com/article/228396/why-enterprise-architecture-maximizes-organizational-value.html), and a faster time to market and innovation. Companies leading the way for EA maturity were more likely to cite experiencing these benefits from the company’s EA strategy compared to the companies that are lagging behind in EA maturity.

EA is also used in systems development, IT management and decision-making, and IT risk management to eliminate errors, system failures, and security breaches. It can also help businesses navigate complex IT structures or to make IT more accessible to other business units.

[According to CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/resources/planning-a-modern-it-architecture), benefits of EA platforms include:

- Allowing more open collaboration between IT and business units
- Giving business the ability to prioritize investments
- Making it easier to evaluate existing architecture against long-term goals
- Establishing processes to evaluate and procure technology
- Giving comprehensive view of IT architecture to all business units outside of IT
- Providing a benchmarking framework to compare results against other organizations or standards

### Enterprise architecture methodologies

Enterprise architecture can appear vague as a framework because it’s meant to address the entire organization, instead of individual needs, problems, or business units. Therefore, several more specific frameworks have evolved to help companies effectively implement and track EAP, including the following four leading EA methodologies, according to CompTIA:

- [The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)](https://www.cio.com/article/228328/what-is-togaf-an-enterprise-architecture-methodology-for-business.html): TOGAF provides principles for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise IT architecture. The TOGAF framework helps businesses create a standardized approach to EA with a common vocabulary, recommended standards, compliance methods, suggested tools and software and a method to define best practices. The TOGAF framework is widely popular as an enterprise architect framework, and according to The Open Group it’s been adopted by more than 80% of the world’s leading enterprises.
- [The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture](https://www.cio.com/article/193229/what-is-the-zachman-framework-a-matrix-for-managing-enterprise-architecture.html): The Zachman framework is named after one of the original founders of enterprise architecture and it’s another popular EA methodology. It’s better understood as a “taxonomy,” according to CompTIA, and it spans six architectural focal points and six primary stakeholders to help standardize and define the IT architecture components and outputs.
- [Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF)](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/cms-information-technology/enterprise-architecture/federal-enterprise-architecture-framework): FEAF was introduced in 1996 as a response to the Clinger-Cohen act, which introduced mandates for IT effectiveness in federal agencies. It’s designed for the U.S. government, but it can also be applied to private companies that want to use the framework.
- [Gartner Enterprise Process and Framework](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/1987417): After acquiring the Meta Group in 2005, Gartner established best practices for EAP and adapted them into the company’s general consulting practices. While it’s not an individual framework, CompTIA recognizes it as a “practical” methodology that focuses on business outcomes with “few explicit steps or components.”

Other EA methodologies include the European Space Agency Architectural Framework (ESA-AF), the UK Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF), and the SAP Enterprise Architecture Framework, among many others. These frameworks are specifically targeted to individual industries or products, targeting more of a niche market than the more generalized EA methodologies previously listed.

The EA marketplace is strong, with more than several dozen serious competitors. Some specialize in specific platforms or clouds. Others offer deeper integration with [business intelligence (BI)](https://www.cio.com/article/272364/business-intelligence-definition-and-solutions.html) and [business process management (BPM)](https://www.cio.com/article/230560/what-is-business-process-management-bpm-the-key-to-enterprise-agility.html) software. Some began life as generic modeling software; others were purpose-built for enterprise architecture. All compile long lists of machines and offer various tabular and graphical dashboards for tracking them.

EA systems gather device and software information in a variety of ways. The most manual process involves asking stakeholders and developers to fill out forms detailing who owns what machines. The most automated tools log into a company’s clouds directly, counting the machines themselves. Most use a hybrid approach. Some offer drag-and-drop widgets so that developers, architects, and managers can create a model of all the machines, the software those machines run, and how the data flows from one machine to another.

Everyone from the CIO to the rapid-response team can use the charts and graphs from an EA dashboard to look up processes and track the flow of data. Some watch for bad machines or overloaded pipelines. They can repair problems by following a cascade of failure. Others plan for the future by finding bottlenecks or shortcuts. All rely on the data in the system as a springboard for making quick decisions.

Many of the tools use [ArchiMate](https://www.archimatetool.com/), an open modeling standard designed to capture much of the complexity of enterprise architecture. It’s built to work closely with the [TOGAF](https://www.cio.com/article/228328/what-is-togaf-an-enterprise-architecture-methodology-for-business.html) open framework. The views and visualizations are created in a manner similar to that of [UML (Unified Modeling Language)](https://www.uml.org/), another generalized approach for visualizing design.

An important consideration is the level of integration with the type of software in your local stack. All the EA tools support big collections of modules that can gather data from particular clouds or operating systems but some support various clouds and operating systems better than others.

Another consideration is their ability to connect with computing and service clouds. Some EA tools specialize in cloud instances and compute pods. All cloud companies maintain their own tools for tracking your systems and some EA tools can absorb this data directly. Single-cloud teams often rely more on the cloud’s own management software to track deployments.

Choosing the best solution for your organization requires evaluating the tools’ ability to integrate with your technology stack and then weighing the usefulness of the charts and tables that the software produces. Following is an overview, in alphabetical order, of the top enterprise architecture platforms available today.
