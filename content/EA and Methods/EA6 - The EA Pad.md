## Introducing EA6

[![[ea6-oad-logo.png]]](https://eapad.dk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ea6-oad-logo.png)Organizational Architecture & Design (OAD) is a holistic management discipline which deals with enterprise transformation. It is especially helpful in periods of restructuring, such as Mergers & Acquisitions.

OAD extends Enterprise Architecture beyond structuring, to include organizational health/viability. The EA3 Cube Framework is used but now enhanced to include areas for risk management, human capital, and valuation. The updated/new framework is therefore called EA6.

## The Six Faces of the Enterprise

[![[ea6-faces-300x140.png]]](https://eapad.dk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ea6-faces.png)

The new (2016) OAD Framework is a “real” cube with six faces. The six-faced OAD Framework includes analysis and design areas for:

- **Structure** – the organizational architecture and design
- **Function** – the functional domain (architecture)
- **Risk** – the governance, risk and compliance
- **Value** – the valuation and benefit realization
- **People** – the human capital
- **Products** – the products and services and supply chain

Our claim is that these exact six views into an enterprise are interrelated in a complex way. In popular terms, we could say that there are always six sides to a story.

## Organizational Structure

Depicts the major business units (BUs) that make up the organization.

Reporting relationships between governance bodies and the BUs are usually depicted through an organization chart and a role/responsibility matrix.

Types of BUs include subsidiary whole companies, internal divisions, departments, stand-alone and integrated lines of business, program and staff offices, cross-functional teams, contractors, and independent workers. External groups may also be depicted if there is a persistent relationship. Oversight of BUs is achieved by centralized or decentralized (federated) governance methods.

## Functional Domains

Depicts the major performance capability areas of an organization, presented hierarchically in sub-architecture domains.

The relationship of these domains is that strategic goals drive business activities/information exchanges, which are enabled by technology systems that are hosted on networks and in facilities. There are industry best practices at each domain level that help with effectiveness and efficiency, but which need to be selected and used with the whole organization in mind. There may also be government regulations and resource constraints that must be factored into plans and projects.

## Risk Management

Depicts key areas of risk in each functional domain and in the BUs. Organizations want to eliminate or limit disruptions that effect mission success or profitability.

Risk derives from uncertainty in predicting or dealing with disruption. Mitigation centers on the avoidance or response actions. Tolerance reflects the acceptable level of exposure to a certain type of disruption and the negative effects that would result. A trigger is something that causes a disruption event.

A holistic approach to managing risk begins at the enterprise level and completes with more detailed procedures at the BU and program levels.

## Markets and Valuation

Depicts the public and private sector markets and/or mission areas that the organization is active in.

For private sector organizations this is the market’s valuation (stock price) versus the aggregate sale value if broken-up. It is also the anticipated value increase or decrease from mergers, acquisitions, start-ups, and spin-offs, as well as a comprehensive balance sheet of monetized assets and liabilities in each business unit.

For public sector organizations it is the liquidation value of all tangible and intangible assets.

## Human Capital

Depicts the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed in each functional domain of the organization. The KSAs are different for executives, managers, and staff in each area.

There is a “cultural core” in each organization that is comprised of the values, norms, beliefs, facts, history, traditions, and methods in each BU and program area.  
Cultural norms create informal power centers, communication channels, and processes.

People are often thought of as the most important and valuable resource of any organization, so full-lifecyle (hire-to-retire) talent management is very important.

## Products & Services

Depicts the tangible or virtual products and services that the organization provides to internal and external customers.

Mission success and profitability are maximized through a holistic approach to delivery with a focus on vertical/horizontal process integration within/between BUs.

Key areas of focus include customer relationships, end-to-end supply chain management, onsite/online store efficiency, and marketing/communications effectiveness. Architecture methods can help to identify gaps and overlaps, process improvement and reengineering projects, managing change, and handling disruption.

## Viewpoints

With the cube, a number of architectural viewpoints can be defined. The eight corners are used to establish intersection triples such as Value-People-Product. More on this later.
