## What is Backlog Epic

A Backlog Epic is a term used to refer to a large user story that is broken down into smaller stories. It is a way of organizing user stories into a hierarchical structure, with the Epic at the top and the smaller stories below it.

An Epic is typically used to represent a large feature or set of features that are related to each other. It is a way of grouping related stories together, so that they can be managed and tracked more easily. The Epic is also used to provide an overview of the feature set, and to provide a way of tracking progress on the feature set as a whole.

## Where did Backlog Epic come from?

A backlog epic is a term used in software development and project management. It is a large user story that is broken down into smaller stories or tasks. It is used to organize and prioritize tasks in a project.

The term was first coined by Mike Cohn, a leading expert in Agile software development. He used the term to describe a large user story that was too big to be completed in one iteration. He suggested breaking it down into smaller stories or tasks that could be completed in a single iteration. This allowed for better organization and prioritization of tasks in a project.

## The role of Backlog Epics

Backlog epics are used to provide a clear overview of the project and its goals. They are used to identify the major tasks that need to be completed and the order in which they should be completed. This helps to ensure that the project is completed in a timely and efficient manner. Backlog epics also provide a way to track progress and identify any potential issues that may arise.

Backlog epics are typically created at the beginning of a project and serve as a roadmap for the project. They provide a high-level overview of the project and its goals, and can be used to identify the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve those goals. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, project managers can better track progress and identify potential issues.

## User Stories vs Epics

The realm of work management in an Agile setting can be likened to the narrative structure of a film or a literary piece. In this landscape, stories serve as the building blocks of a larger narrative - the epic.

-   **Stories**. An Agile team strives to complete stories, which are small, manageable tasks that can be accomplished within a one- or two-week sprint. On a monthly basis, a team of developers may work on dozens of stories.
-   **Epics**. In contrast, epics are fewer in number and encompass a longer timeframe for completion. Teams usually aim to complete two to three epics in a quarter. An epic provides a bird’s eye view of the overarching objective, while stories narrate the work done in its pursuit.

Organizing work into stories and epics facilitates effective communication within an organization. When reporting progress to a higher-up such as the Head of Engineering, epics become the mode of discourse, while discussing work with colleagues on the development team is done at the story level.

### An Example

Consider a scenario where a company endeavors to enhance its streaming service for its rocket launches. A set of stories may include tasks such as providing iPhone users with a vertical view of the live feed, ensuring a “view fullscreen” button for desktop users, and linking Android users to the Apple store. All of these stories contribute to the realization of the larger objective - improving the streaming service for the first quarter launch, which can be considered an epic.

## Why Your Backlog Items May be Epics

Contrary to popular belief, Epics are not simply larger versions of Stories. Rather, they are Backlog Items that the team is unable to reach a consensus on. This distinction highlights the fact that the planning process is rooted in agreement, rather than size. An Epic typically contains at least one Story, whether it be investigatory in nature, or a functional analysis that leads to the creation of additional Stories within the Epic. In cases where the Epic represents an issue or risk, internal Stories may be devised to investigate or mitigate the problem at hand.

There are a multitude of reasons why a Backlog Item may fail to receive agreement from the team. During the planning phase, a Story may evolve into an Epic as the team grapples with uncertainties such as the definition of “Done”, the amount of technical debt involved, or the availability of personnel to complete the task.

## Challenges of using Epics

-   **Managing the scope of the Epic**. A backlog Epic is a large-scale project that can be broken down into smaller tasks. It is important to ensure that the scope of the Epic is well-defined and that all tasks are properly tracked and monitored.
-   **Establishing a timeline**. Establishing a timeline for the completion of the Epic is essential for ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget.
-   **Allocating resources**. Allocating the right resources to the Epic is key to its successful completion. It is important to ensure that the right people are assigned to the right tasks and that they have the necessary skills and experience to complete the project.
-   **Tracking progress**. Tracking progress on the Epic is essential for ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget. It is important to have a system in place to monitor progress and to ensure that any issues are addressed quickly.
-   **Managing risks**. Managing risks associated with the Epic is essential for ensuring that the project is completed successfully. It is important to identify potential risks and to have a plan in place to mitigate them.
