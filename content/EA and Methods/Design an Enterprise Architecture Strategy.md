# Phase 1: Explore the Role of Enterprise Architecture
- Slides 18-
## Phase 1
- Explore a general EA strategy approach
- Introduce Agile Enterprise Architecture
- 19: Enterprise architecture optimizes the outcomes of the entire organization
	- Corporate Strategy -> Enterprise Architecture Strategy 
- 20: Existing EA functions vary in the value they achieve dur to their level of maturity
	- Operationalized: Common EA value (Decreased Cost, Reduced Risk, Cut through Complexity, Increased agility)
	- Emerging (limited Ad Hoc EA function, not aligning business and IT): can't build the value of Operationalized
- 21-22: Benefits of Enterprise Architecture 
	- Focus on business outcomes
	- Traceability of architectural decisions to / from business goals
	- Provides ways to measure results
	- Provides consistency across different LOBs, common vocab
	- Reduces duplications
	- Presents actionable migration the strategy / vision via short term milestones / steps
		- aka "Transition packages"
	- Increases agility
	- Reduces costs
	- Mitigates risks
	- Stimulates innovation
	- Helps achieve stated business goals
	- Enhances competitive advantage of the enterprise
- 23: Qualities of a well established and practical Enterprise Architecture 
	- Objective
	- Impartial
	- Credible
	- Practical
	- Measurable
- 24: Roles of the Enterprise Architecture 
	- Guardrails for the enterprise, so Agile teams work independently in a safe, ready to integration environment
	- Establish strategy 
	- Establish priorities
	- Continuously innovate
	- Establish enterprise standards and enterprise guardrails to guide solution / domain / portfolio architectures
	- Align with and be informed by the org's direction
	- (Also includes a breakdown of Members of the Architectural Board) #ARB 
		- Chief (Business) Strategist
		- Lead Enterprise Architect
		- Business SME from each major domain
		- IT SME from each major domain
		- Operational and Infrastructure SME
		- Security & Risk Officer
		- Process Management
		- Other relevant stakeholders
- 25: For Enterprise Architecture to contribute, EA must address the org's vision and goals
- 26: How does Enterprise Architecture provide value
	- Business and Technology Drivers
	- Vision, Aspirations, Long-Term Goals
	- EA Contributions - contributions that alleviate obstructions
	- Promise of Value
- 27: EA function scope is influenced by EA value proposition and previously developed EA fundamentals
	- EA value prop + EA vision / mission / goals & objectives ->influences-> Org coverage + arch domains + depth + time horizon ->defining-> EA function scope
- 28: EA Team Characteristics (i.e. the EA Strategy Creation Team, not just an individual)
	- Been in the org for a long time and has strong relations with stakeholders -> can become the EA strategy sponsor
	- Someone who understands the diff tech components in the org that support its business operations
	- Someone in the org who can communicate IT concepts to business managers in a language the business understands
	- An individual with a strategy background or perspective on the org. Will understand where the org is headed
	- Any individuals who feel acute pain as a result of poorly made investment decisions -> can be champions of EA strategy in their respective functions
- 29: EA Skills and Competencies (for the team)
	- Arch thinking
	- Analytical
	- Trusted, credible
	- Can handle complexity
	- Can change perspectives
	- Fast learners (both business and technology)
	- Independent and steadfast
	- Not afraid to go against the stream
	- Able to understand problems of others with empathy
	- Able to estimate scaling on design decisions such as model patterns
	- Intrinsic capability to identify where relevant details are
	- Able to identify root causes quickly
	- Able to communicate complex issues clearly
	- Able to negotiate and come up with acceptable solutions
	- Can model well
	- Able to change perspectives (from business to implementation and operational perspectives)
- 30: Use of Enterprise Architecture methodologies
	- Balance EA methodologies with Agile approaches
- 31: Use of Enterprise Architecture methodologies vs Agile methods
	- Use an existing methodology to structure thinking and establish a common vocabulary to communicate basic concepts, processes and approaches
	- Customize the methodology to your needs, making it as lean as possible
	- Execute in an Agile way but keep in mind the thoughtful checks recommended by your end-to-end methodology
	- Clarify goals
	- Have good measures and metrics in place
	- Continuously monitor progress, fit for purpose, etc.
	- Highlight risks, roadblocks, etc.
	- Get support
	- Communicate vision, goals, key decisions, etc.
	- Iterate
- 32: Business strategy first, EA strategy second, EA operating model third
- 33: High-level perspective: creating an effective practice involves many moving parts
	- Environment
	- Business Strategy - how the org adds value and acts as rudder to direct the org
	- Organizational Strategy - defines character of the org, what it wants to be, vision, mission, etc.
	- Core Process - the flow of work through the organization
	- Structure - how people are organized around business processes, including reporting structures, boundaries, roles, and responsibilities
	- Systems - interrelated sets of tasks or activities that organize and coordinate work
	- Culture - personality of the organization, leadership style, attitudes, styles, management practices -> it measures how well philosophy is translated into practice
	- Results - measurement of how well the org achieved its goals
	- Leadership - brings the org together by providing vision and strategy; designing, monitoring, and nurturing the culture, and fostering agility
- 34: The answer to the strategic planning entity dilemma is Enterprise Architecture 
	- Enterprise Architecture is a discipline that defines the structure and operation of an organization
	- The intent of Enterprise Architecture is to determine how an org can most effectively achieve its current and future objectives
- 35: Enterprise Architecture spans across all the domains of architecture
	- Business Architecture is the cornerstone that sets the foundation for all other architectural domains
		- Security, Data, Application, Technology
- 36: Enterprise Architecture deployment continuum
	- If EA practice operates on its own (Centralized), can lead to Ivory Tower and / or Dictatorship
	- If EA practice is embedded with the BUs (Federated) then leads to Balanced and / or Democracy
	- If EA practice is embedded separately within individual BUs (Decentralized) then leads to Siloed and / or abdicates Enterprise role
- 37: Enterprise vs. Program / Portfolio / Domain
	- Decisions at the enterprise level apply across multiple programs / portfolios / solutions and represent the guardrails set for all to play with
	- Enterprise scope: business architecture, technology arch, data arch, applications arch
	- Program / Portfolio scope: bus requirements, business processes, solution architecture
- 38: Decide on the degree of centralization
	- Typically see a need for a centralized repository of reusable assets and standards across the organization, while other approaches / standards can apply locally
	- Centralization
		- Allows for more strategic planning
		- Visibility into standards and assets across the org promotes rationalization and cost savings
		- Ensures enterprise-wide assets are used
		- More strategic sourcing of vendors and resellers
		- Can centrally negotiate pricing for better deals
		- Easier to manage risk and prepare for audits
		- Greater coordination of resources
		- Derives benefits from enterprise decisions e.g. integration
	- Decentralization
		- May allow for more innovation
		- May be easier to demonstrate local compliance if the org is geographically decentralized
		- May be easier to procure software if offices are in different countries
		- Deployment and installation of software on user devices may be easier
- 39: EA Strategy 
	- What is the role of Enterprise Architecture vis-a-vis business goals?
		- What needs to be done?
		- Who needs to be involved?
		- When?
		- Where?
		- Why?
		- How?
- 40: Top-down approach starting from the goals of the org
	- What the Business sees - Bus Goals -> Value Streams -> Capabilities
	- What the CxO sees - Capabilities -> Processes -> actually this is kind of unclear
	- What the App Managers sees - Processes -> Applications
	- What the Program Managers sees - Programs / Projects
	- Need traceability all the way from goals to projects
- 41: Measure EA strategy effectiveness by tracking the benefits it provides to the corporate business goals
	- The success of the EA function spans across three main dimensions
		- The delivery of EA-enabled business outcomes that are most important to the enterprise
		- The alignment between the business and the tech from a planning perspective
		- Improvements in the corporate business goals due to EA contributions (standardization, rationalization, reuse, etc.)
