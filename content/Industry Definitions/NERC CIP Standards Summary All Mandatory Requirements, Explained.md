Whether you are new to NERC CIP compliance or have established security controls aligned with the NERC CIP requirements summary, working with a leading [NERC CIP compliance expert](https://www.rsisecurity.com/compliance-advisory-services/nerc/) will help you remain compliant year-round.

## **What are the NERC CIP Reliability Standards?**

The main goal of the [NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection](https://www.nerc.com/AboutNERC/Documents/NERC%20FAQs%20AUG13.pdf) (CIP) Reliability Standards is to safeguard the integrity of the utility infrastructure in North America, especially for assets connected to IT systems. 

Should the North American utility infrastructure become compromised by a cyberattack, millions of people would be affected by the limited availability of utilities such as:

-   Transportation (e.g., local and interstate trains)
-   Telecommunications (e.g., cell phone and landline service)
-   Electric service for home consumption needs
-   The financial infrastructure supporting banks and payment terminals

Compliance with the NERC CIP standards is critical for all stakeholders of the BES in the following jurisdictions:

-   Eight provinces of Canada
-   One state in Mexico
-   The entire United States of America

[Stakeholders of the BES](https://www.nerc.com/AboutNERC/Documents/NERC%20FAQs%20AUG13.pdf) include:

-   Owners of assets on the BES such as:
    -   Investors owning utilities
    -   Merchants generating electricity
    -   State or municipality entities 
-   Users or consumers of utilities running on the BES
-   Producers of utilities (e.g., gas, electricity, train manufacturers)
-   Suppliers of utilities (e.g., private or publicly-held utility companies)

The process of developing the NERC Reliability Standards is driven by industry insights. As such, any stakeholder directly impacted by the reliability of the North American BES can participate in the development of standards.

-   Data should be preserved, ensuring its preservation does not affect recovery.
-   Recovery plans should be tested at least once every 15 calendar months.
-   Following the testing of a recovery plan, any lessons learned must be documented.

The strength of NERC CIP recovery planning depends on the robustness of documentation processes.

### **CIP-010-3 – Configuration Change Management**  

When it comes to managing changes to configurations and conducting vulnerability assessments, [Standard CIP-010-3](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-010-3.pdf) requires organizations to:

-   Develop baseline change management configurations for security systems that contain:
    -   Operating systems or firmware in instances where there isn’t an independent operating system
    -   Applications sourced commercially or via open source platforms
    -   Custom software installations
    -   Logical network accessible ports
    -   Security patches
-   Document changes that differ from baseline configurations, following authorization
-   Update baseline configurations to reflect changes within 30 days of making the changes
-   Verify that changes to baseline configurations meet the following requirements:
    -   Security controls listed under CIP-005 and CIP-007 are implemented 
    -   The required security controls for baseline configurations are not affected
    -   Results of the verification are documented

Changes to baseline configurations should also be:

-   Tested within a test environment that ensures no adverse effects to baseline configurations or their relevant security controls
-   Documented, after testing is complete, to show the differences between test and production environments

Furthermore, any software installed on security systems must be tested prior to deployment, and the source of the software should be verified. Similar to other NERC CIP controls, BES systems should be monitored every 35 calendar days to identify any risks to the configuration changes.

[Vulnerability assessments](https://blog.rsisecurity.com/how-to-conduct-a-threat-vulnerability-assessment-in-four-steps/) are required every 15 calendar days and may be conducted as paper or active assessments. An active vulnerability assessment should be conducted whenever a new asset is added to the production environment, especially when baseline configuration models differ across assets.
