A smart meter operation center (SMOC) is a central location where all data to monitor and manage the entire Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and smart metering value chain is gathered, displayed and analyzed. A modern SMOC provides tooling support to continuously improve the quality and efficiency of the smart meter operations value chain. Hence, a SMOC is a crucial solution component in a digital utility's IT landscape.

Smart meters provide a number of benefits to utilities, including:

-   **Improved accuracy and reliability of consumption data:** Smart meters can accurately measure consumption data in real-time, eliminating the need for manual meter reading and reducing the risk of errors.
-   **Increased efficiency:** Smart meters allow utilities to remotely read and transmit consumption data, reducing the need for in-person meter readings and improving efficiency.
-   **Enhanced customer service:** Smart meters can provide customers with detailed consumption data, allowing them to make informed decisions about their energy usage and potentially save money on their bills.
-   **Improved outage management:** Smart meters can detect and report outages in real-time, allowing utilities to quickly respond and restore service to affected customers.

A SMOC collects, gathers and displays System-of-Record (SoR) data with smart metering data such as readings, alarms and events in a ”Single Pane of Glass” to improve day to day AMI operations. It provides tooling support to monitor, manage and improve all operational aspects of:

-   **AMI rollout:** Monitor the status of the rollout process and continuously improve the quality of meter installation processes and routines.
-   **Meter operations:** Monitor the status of meter communications and continuously improve the data collection and communication quality.
-   **Metering and billing processes operations:** Monitor the data integration and processing across the entire value chain to continuously improve metering reading reliability and the billing process quality.

In addition to gathering and displaying operational data in this "Single Pan of Glass", the smart meter operation center (SMOC) is also responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting the AMI infrastructure, including the communication networks that connect the meters to the center.

Some SMOC solutions may also come with tooling support leveraging metering data (readings, alarms, events) to create insight and transparency to the low voltage and mid voltage network and with that provide a first step in utilities' transformation to become a data-driven organization.

Overall, the SMOC is an essential component of a smart meter infrastructure, as it enables utilities to effectively manage and monitor the rollout and operation of their smart meter network, providing benefits to both the utility and its customers.
