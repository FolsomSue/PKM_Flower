## Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS)
**An advanced distribution management system (ADMS)** is the software platform that supports the full suite of distribution management and optimization. An ADMS includes functions that automate outage restoration and optimize the performance of the distribution grid. ADMS functions being developed for electric utilities include fault location, isolation and restoration; volt/volt-ampere reactive optimization; conservation through voltage reduction; peak demand management; and support for microgrids and electric vehicles.

In other words, an ADMS is made up of [[SCADA - Wikipedia|SCADA]] + [[Outage Management System - Wikipedia|OMS]] + [[Distribution Management System - Wikipedia|DMS]]+ [[Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS)|DERMS]]
