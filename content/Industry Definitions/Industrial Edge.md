## Industrial Edge Computing Platform

A hybrid approach which adds an industrial edge computing platform software layer to the Purdue Model. “With this layer, you can make your industrial IoT project adhere to each level in the Purdue Model. This platform layer can sit either at Level 2 or Level 3 and provide data collection capability from OT devices at Level 0, 1, 2, and 3, while also facilitating data collection from IT layers at Levels 4 and 5. The benefit is that the traditional hierarchies inherent in the Purdue Model can be bypassed where needed (such as sensors sending data from Level 0 to Level 5) by piping the data through the platform to ensure control and security.”
